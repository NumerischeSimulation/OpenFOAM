# OpenFOAM

Our code related to the OpenFOAM task of the course Numerische Simulation at the University of Stuttgart in the winter term 2021/22

- cavity_2D: modify the configuration of the [Lid-driven cavity tutorial](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/tutorial-guide/2-incompressible-flow/2.1-lid-driven-cavity-flow#x6-60002.1) to match the previous default configuration.
- cavity_3D: extend the tutorial to the 3D case.
- channel_step: modify the geometry of the 2D cavity to get a channel (bounded by solid walls) with a step. The left boundary above the step is the inflow and the right boundary is the outflow.
- karman_vortex_street: get a channel with a cylindric obstacle at the beginning.
